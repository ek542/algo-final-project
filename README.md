# Exploring alternative matching approaches for online dating

This repo contains all the data and code for our CS 5112 [Algorithms and Data Structures for Applications Final Project] (Fall 2021). This project explores clustering and nearest neighbors approaches for matching users assuming that users prefer partners similar to themselves. The goal was to compare different algorithms to group users and then provide many-to-one matches within these groups based on usersâ€™ sex and orientation.

Libraries needed to run the code: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, kmodes, umap-learn
